%Worked on several components of LoadLeveler, which is the scheduler in IBM high
%performance computing software stack.  My prime areas are software configuration
%and network communication. I have added shared memory, database and IPv6 support,
%and designed a new mechanism for trouble shooting,
%which can worked with current tool of Blue Gene system.
%I have also help customers to solve the problem with L2 team.
%
%\begin{description}[leftmargin=\leftskip, labelindent=.12\textwidth]
%    \item[{Dynamic Resource Usage Modification \normalfont(Jan, 2012 - current):}] %
%        Design and implement new feature for modifying resource usage of running job,
%        which improves current code that can only modify idle job.
%        I took charge of implementing update at job scheduler daemon,
%        and reschedule the job in waiting list. This project is under development.
%
%    \item[{Task Migration \normalfont(Jun, 2011 - Jan, 2012):}] %
%        Design and implement the checkpoint/restart feature on Linux platform with lxc module,
%        and add task migration feature to the code. This new feature removed the dependency of third-part library,
%        and improve the stability of product. I have joined the project in the middle and late period,
%        implemented data transfer between departure node arrival node,
%        and help to complete the function in job schedule daemons.
%
%    \item[{Log Enhancement \normalfont(Apr, 2010 - Apr, 2011):}] %
%        Designed and implemented an enhanced log mechanism for examining the running status of LoadLeveler.
%        The new mechanism adds well designed messages to record the running status besides current log system.
%        New added log messages will be gathered into file or database for further analysis.
%        This improvement provides a more quicker and effective method for tracing problem,
%        which also improves the usability of the software.
%
%    \item[{IPv6 Support \normalfont(Oct, 2009 - Mar, 2010):}] %
%        Designed and implemented IPv6 support to the LoadLeveler by refractoring the infrastructure library.
%        With this change, LoadLeveler can be deployed in pure IPv6 and IPv4/IPv6 dual stack environment,
%        which improves the usable range of software and
%        remove the limitation of cluster scale brought by amount of IPv4 address.
%
%    \item[{Configuration Enhancement \normalfont(Dec, 2008 - Sep, 2009):}] %
%        Designed and implemented a new method for saving configuration.
%        The new method add a middle layer between LoadLeveler and configuration source,
%        which encapsulates the underlying operations and provides common interfaces to the upper layer code.
%        With this improvement, LoadLeveler can get configuration from variable sources currently.
%        Another change in this method is saving parsed configuration content into shared memory instead of internal object.
%        This change reduces the complexity of deploying LoadLeveler into large scale cluster.
%        In addition, a new configuration dispatching mechanism has been introduced to the software for decentralizing the configuration server,
%        which can reduce load of the server and improve the cluster's fault tolerance to SPOF.\\
