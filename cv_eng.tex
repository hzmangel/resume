Worked on several components of LoadLeveler, which is the scheduler in IBM high
performance computing software stack.  My prime areas are software configuration
and network communication. I have added shared memory, database and IPv6 support,
and designed a new mechanism for trouble shooting,
which can worked with current tool of Blue Gene system.
I have also help customers to solve the problem with L2 team.

\begin{description}[leftmargin=\leftskip, labelindent=.12\textwidth]
    \item[{Dynamic Resource Usage Modification \normalfont(Jan, 2012 - current):}] %
        Design and implement new feature for modifying resource usage of running job,
        which improves current code that can only modify idle job.
        I took charge of implementing update at job scheduler daemon,
        and reschedule the job in waiting list. This project is under development.

    \item[{Task Migration \normalfont(Jun, 2011 - Jan, 2012):}] %
        Design and implement the checkpoint/restart feature on Linux platform with lxc module,
        and add task migration feature to the code. This new feature removed the dependency of third-part library,
        and improve the stability of product. I have joined the project in the middle and late period,
        implemented data transfer between departure node arrival node,
        and help to complete the function in job schedule daemons.

    \item[{Log Enhancement \normalfont(Apr, 2010 - Apr, 2011):}] %
        Designed and implemented an enhanced log mechanism for examining the running status of LoadLeveler.
        The new mechanism adds well designed messages to record the running status besides current log system.
        New added log messages will be gathered into file or database for further analysis.
        This improvement provides a more quicker and effective method for tracing problem,
        which also improves the usability of the software.

    \item[{IPv6 Support \normalfont(Oct, 2009 - Mar, 2010):}] %
        Designed and implemented IPv6 support to the LoadLeveler by refractoring the infrastructure library.
        With this change, LoadLeveler can be deployed in pure IPv6 and IPv4/IPv6 dual stack environment,
        which improves the usable range of software and
        remove the limitation of cluster scale brought by amount of IPv4 address.

    \item[{Configuration Enhancement \normalfont(Dec, 2008 - Sep, 2009):}] %
        Designed and implemented a new method for saving configuration.
        The new method add a middle layer between LoadLeveler and configuration source,
        which encapsulates the underlying operations and provides common interfaces to the upper layer code.
        With this improvement, LoadLeveler can get configuration from variable sources currently.
        Another change in this method is saving parsed configuration content into shared memory instead of internal object.
        This change reduces the complexity of deploying LoadLeveler into large scale cluster.
        In addition, a new configuration dispatching mechanism has been introduced to the software for decentralizing the configuration server,
        which can reduce load of the server and improve the cluster's fault tolerance to SPOF.\\
